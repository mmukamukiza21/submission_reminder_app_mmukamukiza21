Submission Reminder App
This is a simple Bash-based app that helps track students who have not submitted a specific assignment. It creates a folder structure, loads data, and checks for missing submissions using a startup script

Main script that:

Loads the config and function files
Prints assignment info
Runs the reminder check

 This script:

Asks for your name (e.g., "Milliam")

Creates a folder named submission_reminder_Milliam
Inside the folder, it creates:
config/ → Stores environment config
app/ → Contains reminder.sh (main logic)
modules/ → Contains functions like check_submissions
assets/ → Stores data like the submissions list
It also writes all the necessary .sh files and makes them executable
